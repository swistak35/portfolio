        Competition: Modernism Memorial â€“ A Funerery Monument For The Death of Modernism
    </p>
    <p>
        This concept recall the oppressive urban form of Voisin Plan and criticize it by confronting it with existing city and its inhabitants. A new definition of a memorial monument is a farewell - a temporary structure in urban scale. Eighteen black crosses taken directly from Le Corbusier's plan will be floating above the Parisians' heads throwing a shadow on the existing urban fabric.
